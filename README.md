# cs-capstone-sculpture
Source code for my computer science capstone project where I built an interactive sculpture using either the Arduino or Pyboard microcontroller.
# Software
The Micropython code should be compatible with Micropython versions v1.9.4 and v1.9.3. The arduino code should be compatible with Arduino versions 1.8.6 and 1.8.7.
# Hardware
The Micropython code was tested on Pyboard V1.1. The Arduino code was tested on the Arduino Mega2560 board or, specifically, the Dagu Redback Spider Board. The sculpture employed 4 servos, 2 buzzers, 1 on/off button, and 1 crash sensor.
# Scultpure
Reminiscent of arcade basketball games, the sculpture consists of a basketball court and hoop that sways back forth as a player attempts
to bounce a small ball into the hoop to rack up points during an interval of 45 seconds for each game session.
